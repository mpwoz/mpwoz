Welcome to the redesigned mpwoz.com! 

It was created using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), the static site generator.
For a while I didn't know about static generators, and searched for a solution that
would allow for rapid, convenient development without the overhead of a database-backed
framework. Middleman fills that role. 

Using a combination of Ruby, Coffeescript, [Slim](http://slim-lang.org), and [Sass](sass-lang.org),
development was a pleasure and the result is a static site that any old web server can host!

Look for some Middleman guides in the future as I continue to refine this site.
